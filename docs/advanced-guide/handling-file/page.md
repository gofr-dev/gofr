# Handling File

Gofr simplifies the complexity of working with different filestores by offering a uniform API. This allows developers to interact with different storage systems using the same set of methods, without needing to understand the underlying implementation details of each filestore.

## USAGE

By default, local file-store is initialised and user can access it from the context.

### Creating Directory

To create a single directory
```go
err := ctx.File.Mkdir("my_dir",os.ModePerm)
```

To create subdirectories as well
```go
err := c.File.MkdirAll("my_dir/sub_dir", os.ModePerm)
```

### Creating and Save a File with Content

```go
file, _ := c.File.Create("my_file.text")

_, _ = file.Write([]byte("Hello World!"))

// Closes and saves the file.
	file.Close()
```

### Reading file as CSV/JSON/TEXT
GoFr support reading CSV/JSON/TEXT files line by line.

```go
reader, err := file.ReadAll()

for reader.Next() {
	var b string
		
	// For reading CSV/TEXT files user need to pass pointer to string to SCAN.
	// Incase of JSON user should pass structs with JSON tags as defined in encoding/json.
	err = reader.Scan(&b)

	fmt.Println(b)
}
```


### Opening and Reading Content from a File

To open file with default options
```go
file, _ := c.File.Open("my_file.text")
defer file.Close()

b := make([]byte, 200)

// Read reads up to len(b) bytes into b
_, _ = file.Read(b)
```

### Rename/Move a File

To rename or move a file, provide source and destination fields.
In case of renaming a file provide current name as source, new_name in destination.
To move file from one location to another provide current location as source and new location as destination.

```go
err := c.File.Rename("old_name.text", "new_name.text")
```

### Deleting Files
To delete a single file
```go
err := c.File.Remove("my_dir")
```

To delete all sub directories as well
```go
err := c.File.RemoveAll("my_dir/my_text")
```
