# Interservice HTTP Calls
GoFr promotes microservice architecture and to facilitate the same, it provides the support
to initialize HTTP services at application level using `AddHTTPService()` method.
Support for inter-service http calls provide the following benefits:

1. Access to the method from container - GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE.
2. Logs and traces for the request.
3. [Circuit breaking](/docs/advanced-guide/circuit-breaker) for enhanced resilience and fault tolerance.
4. [Custom Health Check](/docs/advanced-guide/monitoring-service-health) Endpoints

## Usage

### Registering a simple HTTP Service
Users can register a new HTTP service using the application method `AddHTTPService()`. 
It takes in a service name and service address argument to register your dependent service at application level.
Users can easily register multiple dependent services easily, which is a common use case in a microservice architecture.
> The services instances are maintained by the container.

Users can provide other options additionally to coat their basic http client with features like circuit-breaker and 
custom health check to add to the functionality of the HTTP service.
The design choice for this was made so that user can add as many options as required and are order agnostic,
i.e. the order of the options is not important.
> Service names are to be kept unique to one service.

```go
app.AddHTTPService(<service_name> , <service_address>)
```

#### Example
```go
package main

import (
	"gofr.dev/pkg/gofr"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new application
	app := gofr.New()

	// register a payment service which is hosted at http://localhost:9000
	app.AddHTTPService("payment", "http://localhost:9000")

	app.GET("/customer", Customer)

	// Run the application
	app.Run()
}
```

### Accessing HTTP Service in handler
Users can access the HTTP service client from anywhere using the gofr.Context that gets passed on from the handler.
The service name that was given at the time of registering the service.

```go
svc := ctx.GetHTTPService(<service_name>)
```

```go
func Customer(ctx *gofr.Context) (interface{}, error) {
    // Get the payment service client 
    paymentSvc := ctx.GetHTTPService("payment")
	
	// Use the Get method to call the GET /user endpoint of payments service
	resp, err := paymentSvc.Get(ctx, "user", nil)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
	
	defer resp.Body.Close()
	
    body, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    return string(body), nil
}
```
