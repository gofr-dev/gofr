# HTTP Authentication

Authentication is a crucial aspect of web applications, controlling access to resources based on user roles or permissions. 
It is the process of verifying a user's identity to grant access to protected resources. It ensures that only authenticated
users can perform actions or access data within an application.

GoFr offers various approaches to implement authorization.

## 1. HTTP Basic Auth
*Basic Authentication* is a simple HTTP authentication scheme where the user's credentials (username and password) are 
transmitted in the request header in a Base64-encoded format.

Basic auth is the simplest way to authenticate your APIs. It's built on
{% new-tab-link title="HTTP protocol authentication scheme" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617" /%}.
It involves sending the prefix `Basic` trailed by the Base64-encoded `<username>:<password>` within the standard `Authorization` header.

### Basic Authentication in GoFr

GoFr offers two ways to implement basic authentication:

**1. Predefined Credentials**

Use `EnableBasicAuth(username, password)` to configure GoFr with pre-defined credentials.

```go
func main() {
	app := gofr.New()

	app.EnableBasicAuth("admin", "secret_password") // Replace with your credentials

	app.GET("/protected-resource", func(c *gofr.Context) (any, error) {
		// Handle protected resource access
		return nil, nil
	})

	app.Run()
}
```

**2. Custom Validation Function**

Use `EnableBasicAuthWithValidator(validationFunc)` to implement your own validation logic for credentials.
The `validationFunc` takes the username and password as arguments and returns true if valid, false otherwise.

```go
func validateUser(c *container.Container, username, password string) bool {
	// Implement your credential validation logic here
	// This example uses hardcoded credentials for illustration only
	return username == "john" && password == "doe123"
}

func main() {
	app := gofr.New()

	app.EnableBasicAuthWithValidator(validateUser)

	app.GET("/secure-data", func(c *gofr.Context) (any, error) {
		// Handle access to secure data
		return nil, nil
	})

	app.Run()
}
```

### Adding Basic Authentication to HTTP Services
This code snippet demonstrates how to add basic authentication to an HTTP service in GoFr and make a request with the appropriate Authorization header:

```go
app.AddHTTPService("order", "https://localhost:2000",
    &service.Authentication{UserName: "abc", Password: "pass"},
)
```

## 2. API Keys Auth
*API Key Authentication* is an HTTP authentication scheme where a unique API key is included in the request header `X-Api-Key` for validation against a store of authorized keys.

### Usage:
GoFr offers two ways to implement API Keys authentication.

**1. Framework Default Validation**
- GoFr's default validation can be selected using **_EnableAPIKeyAuth(apiKeys ...string)_**

```go
package main

func main() {
	// initialize gofr object
	app := gofr.New()

	app.EnableAPIKeyAuth("9221e451-451f-4cd6-a23d-2b2d3adea9cf", "0d98ecfe-4677-48aa-b463-d43505766915")

	app.GET("/customer", Customer)

	app.Run()
}
```

**2. Custom Validation Function**
- GoFr allows a custom validator function `apiKeyValidator(apiKey string) bool` for validating APIKeys and pass the func in **_EnableAPIKeyAuthWithValidator(validator)_**

```go
package main

func apiKeyValidator(c *container.Container, apiKey string) bool {
	validKeys := []string{"f0e1dffd-0ff0-4ac8-92a3-22d44a1464e4", "d7e4b46e-5b04-47b2-836c-2c7c91250f40"}

	return slices.Contains(validKeys, apiKey)
}

func main() {
	// initialize gofr object
	app := gofr.New()

	app.EnableAPIKeyAuthWithValidator(apiKeyValidator)

	app.GET("/customer", Customer)

	app.Run()
}
```

### Adding API-KEY Authentication to HTTP Services
This code snippet demonstrates how to add API Key authentication to an HTTP service in GoFr and make a request with the appropriate Authorization header:

```go
app.AddHTTPService("http-server-using-redis", "http://localhost:8000", &service.APIKeyConfig{APIKey: "9221e451-451f-4cd6-a23d-2b2d3adea9cf"})
```

## 3. OAuth 2.0
{% new-tab-link title="OAuth" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749" /%} 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. 
It focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.

It involves sending the prefix `Bearer` trailed by the encoded token within the standard `Authorization` header.

### OAuth Authentication in GoFr

GoFr supports authenticating tokens encoded by algorithm `RS256/384/512`. 

### App level Authentication
Enable OAuth 2.0 with three-legged flow to authenticate requests. Use `EnableOAuth(jwks-endpoint,refresh_interval, options ...jwt.ParserOption)` to configure GoFr with pre-defined credentials.

### Description
`EnableOAuth` configures OAuth authentication middleware for the application.

- It registers a new HTTP service to fetch **JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS)**, which are used to verify JWTs.
- The JWKS endpoint is periodically refreshed based on the specified refresh interval.
- Additional JWT validation options can be passed using `jwt.ParserOption`, allowing fine-grained control over claim validation.

### Parameters
| Parameter        | Type                | Description |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `jwksEndpoint`   | `string`           | URL of the JWKS endpoint used to retrieve signing keys for token verification. |
| `refreshInterval` | `int`              | Interval (in seconds) at which the JWKS cache is refreshed. |
| `options`        | `...jwt.ParserOption` | Optional JWT claim validation configurations, such as issuer, audience, and expiration requirements. |

### Available JWT Claim Validations

#### Expiration (`exp`) Validation
If the `exp` claim is present, it is always validated to ensure the token has not expired. However, to make the `exp` claim mandatory in our JWT tokens, we can use:

```go
jwt.WithExpirationRequired()
```
> This ensures that every token must include the `exp` claim, making expiration validation a strict requirement.

#### Issued At (`iat`) Validation
If the `iat` claim is present, it is ensured that tokens are not accepted before their issuance time. No additional configuration is needed for this validation.

#### Not Before (`nbf`) Validation
If the `nbf` claim is present, it is always validated to ensure that a JWT is only valid after a certain time. No additional configuration is needed for this validation.

#### Audience (`aud`) Validation
Verifies that the token is intended for the expected audience.

```go
jwt.WithAudience("https://api.example.com")
```

#### Subject (`sub`) Validation
Ensures the token is associated with the expected subject.

```go
jwt.WithSubject("user@example.com")
```

#### Issuer (`iss`) Validation
Ensures the token is issued by a trusted authority.

```go
jwt.WithIssuer("https://auth.example.com")
```

### Example

```go
func main() {
	app := gofr.New()

	app.EnableOAuth(
		"http://jwks-endpoint", 
		20,
        jwt.WithExpirationRequired(), // to enforce presence of exp claim in every token
        jwt.WithAudience("https://api.example.com"),
        jwt.WithIssuer("https://auth.example.com")
		)

	app.GET("/protected-resource", func(c *gofr.Context) (any, error) {
		// Handle protected resource access
		return nil, nil
	})

	app.Run()
}
```

### Adding OAuth Authentication to HTTP Services
For server-to-server communication it follows two-legged OAuth, also known as "client credentials" flow,
where the client application directly exchanges its own credentials (ClientID and ClientSecret)
for an access token without involving any end-user interaction.

This code snippet demonstrates how two-legged OAuth authentication is added to an HTTP service in GoFr and make a request with the appropriate Authorization header:

```go
app.AddHTTPService("orders", "http://localhost:9000",
    &service.OAuthConfig{   // Replace with your credentials
        ClientID:     "0iyeGcLYWudLGqZfD6HvOdZHZ5TlciAJ",
        ClientSecret: "GQXTY2f9186nUS3C9WWi7eJz8-iVEsxq7lKxdjfhOJbsEPPtEszL3AxFn8k_NAER",
        TokenURL:     "https://dev-zq6tvaxf3v7p0g7j.us.auth0.com/oauth/token",
        Scopes:       []string{"read:order"},
        EndpointParams: map[string][]string{
            "audience": {"https://dev-zq6tvaxf3v7p0g7j.us.auth0.com/api/v2/"},
    },
})
```
