# Observability

Now that you have created your server, lets see how GoFr by default manages observability in different ways:

## Logs

Logs offer real-time information, providing valuable insights and immediate visibility into the ongoing state and activities of the system.
It helps in identifying errors, debugging and troubleshooting, monitor performance, analysing application usage, communications etc.

GoFr logger has customizable log level which provides flexibility to adjust logs based on specific needs.

Logs are generated only for events equal to or above the specified log level, by default GoFr logs at _INFO_ level.
Log Level can be changed by setting the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` value to _WARN,DEBUG,ERROR,NOTICE or FATAL_.

When we run our server we see the following - logs for reading configs, database connection, requests, database queries, logs for missing configs etc.
They contain information such as request's correlation ID, status codes, request time etc.

Logs are well-structured, they are of type JSON when exported to a file, such that they can be pushed to logging systems such as {% new-tab-link title="Loki" href="https://grafana.com/oss/loki/" /%}, elastic search etc.

## Metrics

Metrics enable performance monitoring by providing insights into response times, latency, throughput, and resource utilization.

They aid in tracking CPU, memory, and disk I/O consumption across services, facilitating capacity planning and scalability efforts.

Metrics play a pivotal role in fault detection and troubleshooting, offering visibility into system behavior.

They are instrumental in measuring and meeting service-level agreements (SLAs) to ensure expected performance and reliability.

GoFr by default publishes metrics automatically to port: _2121_ on _/metrics_ endpoint in prometheus format.

For example: When running application locally, you can access /metrics endpoint on port 2121 from: {% new-tab-link title="http://localhost:2121/metrics" href="http://localhost:2121/metrics" /%}

GoFr also provides supports to create requirement specific metrics using {% new-tab-link newtab=false title="custom metrics" href="/docs/advanced-guide/publishing-custom-metrics" /%}.

## Tracing

Tracing is a powerful tool for gaining insights into your application's behaviour, identifying bottlenecks, and improving
system performance. A trace is a tree of spans. It is a collective of observable signals showing the path of work
through a system. A trace on its own is distinguishable by a `TraceID`.

In complex distributed systems, understanding how requests flow through the system is crucial for troubleshooting performance
issues and identifying bottlenecks. Traditional logging approaches often fall short, providing limited visibility into
the intricate interactions between components.

To know more about Tracing click {% new-tab-link title="here" href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/#traces" /%}.

### Automated Tracing in GoFr

GoFr makes it easy to use tracing by automatically adding traces to all requests and responses. GoFr uses
{% new-tab-link title="OpenTelemetry" href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/what-is-opentelemetry/" /%} , a popular tracing framework, to
automatically add traces to all requests and responses.

**Automatic Correlation ID Propagation:**

When a request enters your GoFr application, GoFr automatically generates a correlation ID X-Correlation-ID and adds it
to the response headers. This correlation ID is then propagated to all downstream requests. This means that you can track
a request as it travels through your distributed system by simply looking at the correlation ID in the request headers.

### Configuration & Usage

To see the traces install zipkin image using the following docker command

```bash
  docker run --name gofr-zipkin -p 2005:9411 -d openzipkin/zipkin:latest
```

Add Tracer configs in `.env` file, your .env will be updated to

```bash
APP_NAME=test-service
HTTP_PORT=9000

REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=root123
DB_NAME=test_db
DB_PORT=3306

# tracing configs
TRACER_HOST=localhost
TRACER_PORT=2005

LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

> **NOTE:** If the value of `TRACER_PORT` is not
> provided, gofr uses port `9411` by default.

Open {% new-tab-link title="zipkin" href="http://localhost:2005/zipkin/" /%} and search by TraceID (correlationID) to see the trace.
