# GRPC Server Example

This GoFr example showcases a basic gRPC server implementation. For detailed instructions on setting up gRPC handlers with GoFr’s context support—enabling built-in tracing and database integration within your gRPC handlers—please refer to our [official documentation](https://gofr.dev/docs/advanced-guide/grpc).

### To run the example use the command below:
```console
go run main.go
```
