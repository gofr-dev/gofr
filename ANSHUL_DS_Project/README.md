# DoS Attack Simulation Project

## Description
This project demonstrates a Denial of Service (DoS) attack simulation for educational purposes. It showcases how a server or network resource can be overwhelmed by excessive traffic, making it unavailable for legitimate users.

*Note:* This project is strictly for ethical learning and cybersecurity awareness. All tests were conducted in a controlled environment.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scapy / Socket programming
- Flask (for target simulation)
- Wireshark (for packet analysis)

## Features
- Simulates a basic DoS attack using packet floods
- Real-time server response monitoring
- Educational logs and documentation for awareness
- Completely local environment â€“ no real systems are harmed

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Flask installed (pip install flask)
- Scapy installed (pip install scapy)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository
2. Start the target server:
3.Run the DoS attack script:
4. Use Wireshark or netstat to monitor traffic

## Disclaimer
This project is for *educational purposes only. Performing DoS attacks on real-world systems is **illegal* and punishable under cyber laws. Always run this simulation in isolated environments.
